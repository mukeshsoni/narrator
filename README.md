How to see stuff - 

```
npm run build
npm start
```

To build the renderer in watch mode so that changes to renderer are reflected in
the main process -

```
npm run build:renderer -- --watch
npm start
```

You can also build recorder and findandselect modules in watch mode. But you
probably won't have to.
